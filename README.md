# Combinatorial-and-Optimization-Algorithms

Implementation of important sequences, algorithms in combinatorics and graph theory with applications in life systems. Some of those are Motzkin's, Catalan's, Sterling's, Delannoy's, Narayana's, Schroder's, Lazy Caterer's numbers, some algorithms from Graph theory and some corollaries from Graph Theory theorems.
