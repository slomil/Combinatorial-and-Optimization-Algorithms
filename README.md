# Combinatorial-and-Optimization-Algorithms

Implementation of some of the important sequences and algorithms in combinatorics and graph theory with applications in computer, biological and other systems. Some of those are Motzkin's, Catalan's, Sterling's, Delannoy's, Narayana's, Schroder's, Lazy Caterer's numbers, some algorithms from Graph theory and some corollaries from Graph Theory theorems.
